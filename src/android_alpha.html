          <p class="subtitle">Wanna take a peek at the upcoming release of DOT?</p>
          <hr/>
          <p>To signup for the Destiny Objective Tracker Alpha program, 
            you'll need to provide your Google Play email address, which can be done over at
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-YcNsIzB7qwhtlx2diHGVzw5x3yyQia6t8LnYIv1ELZMLkg/viewform">this form.</a></p>
          <p>That form will ask you for your email address, and optionally what you'd like to be called by potentially in the future. These details are confidential,
              and your email address is strictly only used to be granted authorization to the app page on the Google Play Store. You'll also need to acknowledge a short disclaimer before the form will let you submit it.</p>
          
          <p><em>If you prefer not to provide an email address, you will need to wait for DOT to hit beta, where it will be open for all to access, without needing authorization.</em></p>

          <p>After you've been added to the program (I promise to do so as quickly as I can!) you will be able to download the app from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.omnicron.apps.android.dot">here</a>, so check back soon!</p>

          <div class="content">
            <h3 class="title">Requirements</h3>
            <p>In order to participate in the Alpha program, you'll need to have/meet these requirements:</p>

              <li>An Android device running Android 7.0 or higher</li>
              <li class="ml-4">(DOT is designed to be viewed on a phone, however you are free to run it on a tablet!)</li>
              <li>A <a href="https://bungie.net">Bungie.net</a> account &mdash; If you do not have one, you will be prompted to select the platform you play the game on to create one</li>
              <li>You will need to have played Destiny 2 at least once, to generate save-data on your account</li>
              <li class="ml-4">Also, your account needs at least one character saved in your game data</li>

            <h3 class="title">Submitting Feedback</h3>
            <p>I am always appreciative of any feedback you have of DOT, whether it's about something you liked or disliked, a bug you found, feature request, etc &mdash; I consider it to be "good" feedback!</p>
            <p>There are a few ways you can submit your feedback to me:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Found a bug or have a feature request? DOT's issue tracker can be found <a href="https://github.com/russjr08/DOT-Android/issues">here</a>, and anyone with a GitHub account is free to make a submission!</li>
              <li class="ml-4"><em>The GitHub link from above can also be found within DOT itself, on the navigation drawer</em></li>
              <li>If you prefer not to use GitHub, you can also reach out to me via the following:</li>
              <li>Discord &mdash; <a href="https://discord.gg/SfkzHPg">Click here</a> for a server invite to my Discord, or private message me [@russjr08#5539]</li>

              <li>If you prefer the classic approach of email, you can email me at <a href="mailto:Russell+DOT@omnicron.xyz">Russell+DOT@omnicron.xyz</a></li>
